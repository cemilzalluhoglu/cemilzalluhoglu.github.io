<p style="font-family:arial;">
   Collective activity recognition is an important subtask of human action recognition, where the existing datasets are mostly limited. In this paper, we look into this issue and introduce the ''Collective Sports (C-Sports)'' dataset, which is a novel benchmark dataset for multi-task recognition of both collective activity and sports categories. Various state-of-the-art techniques are evaluated on this dataset, together with a multi-task variant, which demonstrates increased performance. From the experimental results, we can say that while the sports action category recognition is relatively an easy task, there is still room for improvement for collective activity recognition, especially for the distant view situations. We believe that C-Sports dataset will stir further interest in this research direction.

   <p style="font-family:arial;">In order to evaluate the , we collected a new video dataset called Collective Sports (C-Sports) that includes eleven sports categories and five colletive activitiy classes. 
In C-Sports dataset, there are 11 sports categories and five collective activity categories. Sports categories are <i>American football, basketball, dodgeball, football, handball, hurling, ice hockey, lacrosse, rugby, volleyball and water polo</i>, whereas five collective activities are <i>gathering, dismissal, passing, attack and wandering </i>.  <i>Gathering</i> can be defined as people approaching each other for a specific purpose. <i>Dismissal</i> is the separation of people to different directions after gathering. <i>Pass</i> is the act of passing items, such as balls, hockey rubbers, etc., between players, whereas <i>attack</i> is the movement of the team players towards a specific goal. <i>Wandering</i> activity, on the other hand, can be defined as the free movements of team players. </p>
   
<p style="font-family:arial;">Sample video frames for sports classes are given in Fig. 1, and for collective activity classes in Fig. 2, Each video in the dataset has two labels, one indicating the sports category and the other indicating the class of the ongoing collective activity.</p>
